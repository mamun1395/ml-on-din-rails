# Machine Learning on DIN rails

Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning on Fieldbus. This is part of the Master thesis.

## Dataset

`dataset` folder contains two folders namely `raw_dataset` and `processed_dataset`.

## Getting Started

1. `data_visualization.ipynb` visualizes the raw datasets for network configuration 1 and network configuration 2.

2. `data_processing.ipynb` transforms raw dataset folders into one single file on which ML algorithms can be applied.
